Greetings all from IIM Ahmedabad!

The OINK team has landed here in India for ICTD&nbsp;X, the
[Tenth International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies](https://www.ictdx.org/).
Noah will be giving a presentation about OINK on [Monday morning][session].
We'll also be at the demo session on Sunday afternoon.
For those not here at ICTD, please check out the [livestream][livestream]
or you can [read the paper here][paper].

In addition to meeting the ICTD community, one of our big goals while we're
here is to solicit feedback on the ideas in OINK and see how well it can work
for the studies that folks have run, are running, or are planning in the future.
Whether or not you are at ICTD, if you are a practitioner, please consider
[filling out our (short!) survey][survey].

Looking forward to meeting everyone!
